# political-bias-detection

News media is an extremely important component
of daily discourse and is one of the main sources for
the public to form their opinions. However, news
articles are written by humans and inevitably, bi-
ases are be introduced into them. This can have far-
reaching consequences in terms of public opinion
and can sometimes be detrimental to law and order,
which is evident in todayâ€™s discussions. Events like
the 2016 and 2020 U.S. Presidential elections had
widely polarizing statements being made by politi-
cal leaders, the most exemplary one being Donald
J. Trump. Conservative news sources were more
favorable towards Trump, and liberal news sources
were more antagonistic towards Trump.
The research questions we try to answer in our
project are:

<ol>
  <li>RQ1: How feature selection impacts political
bias detection? What kinds of embeddings
help the models to learn better?</li>
  <li>RQ2: Is it possible to eliminate the political
bias from the news articles in a systematic
way?</li>
</ol>

To this extent, we formulated our problem state-
ment as detecting political bias in news media and
eliminating it in a systematic way. Our key contri-
butions can be summarized as
<ol>
  <li>Sentence-level contextualized embeddings are
a better feature representation in detecting po-
litical bias than word or paragraph embed-
dings on news corpus datasets.</li>
  <li>Bias elimination in news articles is possible to
an extent, however this still remains an open-
ended question.</li>
</ol>
